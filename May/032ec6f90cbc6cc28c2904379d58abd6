It is Thursday lunchtime and you know the drill – it is time for our exciting weekly quiz, newly christened “the Thursday quiz” after literally seconds of discussion in the office. Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical news trivia, laced with a few weird facts and some jokes – and this week there is a hint of Eurovision in the air. It is just for fun and there are no prizes, but do let us know how you get on in the comments below. The Thursday quiz, No 4 If you think there has been an egregious error in one of the questions or answers, please  email martin.belam@theguardian.com but remember, the quizmaster’s word is final and you don’t want him to come round to your house and insist you watch Eurovision together, do you?
