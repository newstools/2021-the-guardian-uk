It is Thursday lunchtime, and so it must be time for the second edition of our exciting new weekly quiz. You’ll face 15 questions on general knowledge and topical news trivia and possibly a couple of terrible jokes in the answer text. It is just for fun and there are no prizes, but do let us know how you get on in the comments below. The weekly Guardian quiz, No 2 If you do think there has been an egregious error in one of the questions or answers, please feel free to email martin.belam@theguardian.com but remember, the quizmaster’s word is always final and you don’t want him putting you on the list.
