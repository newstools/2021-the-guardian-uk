No 10 says “We are not yet in a position to confirm that non-essential international travel can resume from that point”, ie 17 May (Boris Johnson confirms easing of England lockdown next week, 6 April). What is “non-essential international travel”? The regulations permit international travel for business and the buying and selling of property. However, they do not permit me to visit my children and grandchildren, who live in mainland Europe and whom I have not seen for many months. I live on my own (I am a widow). I have had two solitary Easters, one solitary Christmas, and spent my 70th birthday and my daughter’s and daughter-in-law’s 40th birthdays separated from my close family. My 71st birthday is before 17 May. I am unbearably lonely and desperately sad. The travel restrictions are cruel and inhumane, putting money-making and property before family and loved ones. Perhaps this is a cause which Keir Starmer could take up? I cannot be the only UK citizen in this heartbreaking position.Alison MorleyLeeds
