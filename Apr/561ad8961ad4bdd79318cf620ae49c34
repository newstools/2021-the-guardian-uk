Many of us struggle to get a good night’s rest – but for those who find it hard to fall or stay asleep, there are things that can help. Taking a warm bath before bed, for example, is often recommended, as is cutting out caffeine and minimising late-night screen time. Often, the key is discovering what works for you. Perhaps you find eating a particular food conducive to a full night’s kip? Or maybe you swear by listening to a certain podcast, or spraying your pillow with a specific scent?
