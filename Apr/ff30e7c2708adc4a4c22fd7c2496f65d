An Australian couple has expressed their relief after being freed from house arrest in Myanmar and allowed to leave the country. But there are still serious concerns for another Australian, Sean Turnell, who has been imprisoned since the army seized control of the country on 1 February. Australian business consultants Christa Avery and Matthew O’Kane were initially refused permission to leave Myanmar last month when they were about to board a flight home. They have since been released from home detention without charge and flew out of Yangon on Sunday. “I am, of course, incredibly relieved to have been released and to be on my way home with my husband Matt,” Avery said in a statement. “Even though I knew that I had done nothing wrong, it was very stressful being held under house arrest for two weeks.” Turnell, an economic adviser to elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, has been detained since the military coup. “I hope that even if Sean cannot be released very soon, he can, at least, be moved to house arrest for his physical, mental and emotional wellbeing,” Avery said. Authorities have said Turnell is under investigation, but no charges have been announced against him. More than 2500 government politicians, civilian leaders and foreigners have been detained since the coup. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided consular assistance to Avery and O’Kane during their detention. The department also supported their departure from Yangon. “We welcome their release,” a spokesman told AAP. “Due to our privacy obligations we will not provide further detail.” Consular assistance generally involves welfare checks, liaising with local authorities, providing lists of local lawyers and helping communicate with family members or close contacts. Embassy staff cannot provide legal advice, intervene in legal cases or get Australians out of prison.
