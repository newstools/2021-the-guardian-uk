As a devotee of the music of Chris Barber, I arranged with his wife, Kate, to visit him 18 months ago. She encouraged me to talk about motor racing rather than jazz. This was easy, as I had spent many years filming Grand Prix races. Chris was thrilled to see the Silverstone programmes from the 1960s that I took him, as he had known many of the drivers listed. When I sent further articles on the subject, Kate told me that he read them avidly.
