I can only agree with Grace Dent (12 March) that strong feelings and dishwasher stacking go hand in hand. The passion aroused can be expressed by a few tweaks to the final verse of a Frank Sinatra hit: “For what is a man, what has he got? / If not his dishwasher-stacking-method, then he has naught / With my procedure no plate will reveal / The baked-on remains of yesterday’s meal / The record shows / I stacked the bowls / And did it my way.”Steve DaggittKidlington, Oxfordshire • The NHS is placing full-page adverts in newspapers showing a young woman hunched on her sofa using her laptop, telling people to work from home.

Isn’t it more likely that the “strike rate of the whalers’ harpoons fell by 58%” because they had already killed over half the whale population?Pete LavenderWoodthorpe, Nottinghamshire • You report (16 March) that scientists have unlocked the secret of why hummingbirds hum.
