Pep Guardiola has described Sergio Agüero as “irreplaceable” and credited him with helping Manchester City to “a higher level”, as the striker prepares to leave the Etihad Stadium at the end of the season. City’s all-time record goalscorer will depart when his contract expires and Guardiola has paid a glowing tribute to the 32-year-old, who has won four Premier League titles, an FA Cup, and five League Cups during his decade-long stay. “Sergio is irreplaceable,” City’s manager told Sky Sports. “I could say in terms of numbers he can be replaceable; it’s not easy when you see more than 360 games played and more than 250 goals, the amount of titles ... “So it’s the legend, the best striker this club has ever had for this century through the years, but is irreplaceable in the souls, in the hearts, in the minds of our fans, of our people, of the players that played alongside him and all the managers who worked with him. “We were so lucky, the guys who came after him – me as a manager for example. We took over the club and he was one of the guys like Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, David Silva, many players helped this club make a step forward and of course he was one of them. “He helped us find a club organisation in a higher level. When he came here the club was in one level, and he helped to put the club in a higher level. And that’s why all the people are still here, and of course the fans always will be grateful. “Without them, what we achieved in the past four or five years would not be possible, that’s for sure.” Guardiola backed the Argentinian to score important goals as City chase an unprecedented quadruple. “I think he still has interesting goals to score this season,” he said.
