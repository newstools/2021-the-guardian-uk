A historic first meeting of leaders of the Quad – an informal grouping of Australia, the United States, India and Japan – has ended with a promise to boost manufacturing of the Covid-19 vaccine to help low-income countries and to keep international climate goals within reach. The leaders during the meeting agreed to pool financing, manufacturing and distribution capacity to send 1 billion coronavirus vaccines to Asian and Pacific island countries by the end of 2022. In a joint statement released after the first meeting, the four leaders called for a “transparent and results-oriented reform” of the World Health Organization and said they would work to strengthen climate actions of all nations. The WHO has made strong calls to rich countries for “vaccine equity” to make sure poorer countries have the same level of access to vaccines as rich countries. The United States president, Joe Biden, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, met virtually in the early hours of Saturday, Canberra time – the first time the four-member regional grouping had ever convened with heads of government. The Quad countries say they will co-ordinate with COVAX – the international buying facility for vaccines – and raise manufacturing capabilities in India through that country’s Bio E vaccine manufacturing company. The US Development Finance Corporation will fund increased capacity at Bio E to produce at least 1 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2022. In his opening remarks, Morrison said: “As we emerge from this global pandemic, and the global recession, let us together create a different future. It is the Indo-Pacific that will now shape the destiny of our world in the 21st century.” He said a new Quad vaccine partnership would make sure expanded manufacturing of vaccines would be for “global benefit” and countries in the Indo-Pacific region would get help from “vaccine readiness” to addressing vaccine misinformation and immunisation capacity. Australia will commit $100m to buy vaccines for south-east Asian countries. A Quad vaccine experts group will also be launched to design a plan to implement the Quad’s vaccine work. On climate change, a new Quad climate working group will work to “keep a Paris-aligned temperature limit within reach”. Australia has faced criticism for refusing to commit to a mid-century target of reaching net-zero emissions. A fact sheet released after the Quad meeting did not mention a net-zero target, or say whether the “Paris-aligned target” referred to 1.5C of global heating or the UN commitment to keep temperatures “well below 2C” by the end of the century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has previously indicated global carbon dioxide emissions would need to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 in order to ensure no or limited overshoot of 1.5C. The fact sheet did refer to committing to advancing “low emissions technology solutions”, which is the Australian government’s preferred approach. China views the Quad warily because it sees it as a “mini-Nato” and an effort to contain its growing influence. An historic meeting for India, the United States, Japan and Australia - the first ever leaders’ meeting of the Quad. For us, this meeting is about how we keep Australia and the Indo-Pacific region we live in safe, stable and secure. 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 🇯🇵 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/Uk40KccJTJ Morrison was joined in the virtual meeting by the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the secretaries of the prime minister’s department and the foreign affairs department, while other leaders were also accompanied by senior ministers and officials. Suga said the group had agreed to meet in person within a year. 今回の会議は、日米豪印の4カ国を、新たなステージに引き上げることができた会合だったと思います。年内に対面での首脳会談を行うことでも一致しました。これから4カ国を中心に、野心的な、そして具体的な成果を出せるよう協力してまいります。 pic.twitter.com/by8IQsj5ws Some analysts have described the first Quad leaders’ meeting as “a historic step” that signals “a new level of political determination to balance together against Chinese power” among the US, Australia, India and Japan. Prof Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University, said the meeting showed the importance Biden’s administration was putting on the region. He said Biden had “reshaped” the Quad to be a more constructive and positive force that was open to co-operation, which was a significant shift from a Trump-era approach that was more confrontational. He said the Biden administration was instead opening the door for China to engage and co-operate with the Quad countries, while still allowing competition. “America wants to compete with China and win the hearts and minds of the rest of Asia, rather than take a zero-sum approach.” Medcalf said the Quad would also give the US an opportunity to further push Australia to increase its climate ambition. Biden sent a signal on the priority he placed on climate by inviting his special envoy, John Kerry, to be part of his delegation, which also included the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Last month Kerry publicly acknowledged past “differences” between the US and Australia in tackling the climate crisis while calling for a faster exit from coal-fired power around the globe. Among the Quad grouping, the US and Japan have already committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, while Australia has expressed a preference to achieve the goal without making a firm pledge amid pushback from the Nationals. India also has not committed to net zero by 2050 but has promised to exceed expectations. On Monday the US and the UK issued a joint statement urging all countries “to take the steps needed to keep a 1.5C temperature limit within reach, including through ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero”.
