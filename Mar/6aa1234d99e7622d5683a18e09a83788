Liam and Noel Gallagher, the rock star brothers whose falling-out has been one of the bitterest in music history, have formed a new film production company together. Kosmic Kyte Ltd was formed on 24 February, and is classed as a “motion picture production company” with the Gallaghers listed as the sole directors. Press representatives for each musician would not offer further comment to the Guardian. Liam Gallagher alluded to the project on Twitter, writing: “There gonna put in the movies there gonna make a big star out of me c’mon you know.” The mysterious company will rekindle Oasis fans’ hopes of a cessation of hostilities between the brothers. The fraternal banter which characterised their time in the multimillion-selling band has soured in recent years, with Liam comparing Noel and his wife Sara MacDonald to serial killers Fred and Rosemary West, and blaming MacDonald for the Oasis split. Noel also accused Liam of sending threatening messages to Noel’s daughter Anaïs, with Liam later apologising. In 2019, Noel also threatened Liam with legal action over the documentary As It Was, forbidding him from using Oasis material on the soundtrack. Liam has publicly longed for an Oasis reunion, telling Noel in 2018: “Let’s get the big O back together and stop fucking about”, and said in 2020 that the idea of a reunited Oasis had been “booted around … it’s gonna happen very fucking soon because [Noel]’s greedy and he loves money”. In 2020, Noel said he had considered a reunion, telling Vogue: “I’ve often thought, let’s just do a gig”, but also admitted: “I realised I would only be doing it to shut this fucking idiot up.” The Gallaghers have separately appeared in a critically acclaimed documentary about Oasis’s formative years, Supersonic, released in 2016 and directed by Mat Whitecross.
