I was dismayed to learn that the work of Voluntary Service Overseas may be severely curtailed (Voluntary Service Overseas set to exit 14 countries after aid budget cut, 15 March). VSO makes a huge impact in improving life in countries where it has active projects, encouraging self-sufficiency in cost-effective ways. Many communities continue to benefit long after the volunteer placement has ended. It also gives opportunities to volunteers of all ages to share skills and expertise, and have what is for many a life-changing experience, with a long-term impact on their resilience. At a time when the UKâ€™s reputation in the world is uncertain, this is a shortsighted policy.Caroline DeanNewcastle upon Tyne
