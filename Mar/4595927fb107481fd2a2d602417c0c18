Re your correspondent’s letter about a lack of tutorial support for their son (1 March), I want to add my voice as both a lecturer, encouraged by my university to offer additional support to my students, who are isolated and lonely as well as tired of online learning, but also as a mother whose son was dismissively told by one lecturer: “I won’t be offering online seminars as it doesn’t suit my style.” However much we can do online, many students’ learning is impaired in the current situation, and we must do all we can to mitigate this, within our capacities. One student said to me after a tutorial: “Thank you. I have been feeling two-dimensional, but now I feel human again.”Sue MayoGoldsmiths, University of London
