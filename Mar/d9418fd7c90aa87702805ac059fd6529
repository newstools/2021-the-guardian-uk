A container ship nearly 100 metres longer than the height of London’s Shard ran aground on Tuesday morning in the Suez canal, blocking one of the most vital arteries of the global economy. The Ever Given, a 220,000-ton, Taiwan-owned “megaship” became lodged in the sand of the eastern bank of the Egyptian canal on Tuesday morning, and was still partially stuck more than a day later. Typically about 50 vessels pass through the canal every day carrying everything from fuel to consumer goods, representing about one-tenth of the world’s shipping by tonnage. The Ever Given, one of a fleet of ships run by Evergreen, is carrying hundreds of containers bound for Rotterdam from Yantian in China. The main alternative route for ships travelling between Asia and Europe, around the African cape, takes a week longer to navigate. Some shipping is being diverted through “historical” sections of the channel, which has been widened and deepened in places over the decades to accommodate ever larger ships. Egyptian authorities have blamed the grounding on high winds and a sandstorm that hit the area on Tuesday that kicked up gusts of up to 31mph. About 110 vessels have already banked up on both sides of the stricken ship, including five tankers laden with liquefied natural gas and seven carrying about 6.3m barrels of crude oil. The blockage could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East, with the price of international benchmark Brent crude jumping by nearly 2.9% to $62.52 a barrel on Wednesday. The Ever Given is one of a new category of ships called ultra-large container ships (ULCS), some of which are even too big for the Panama canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific. The Suez canal’s role as a cornerstone of international trade, particularly in oil, led the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to announce an expansion of the vital waterway in 2014, at a cost of $8bn (£5.2bn at that time).
