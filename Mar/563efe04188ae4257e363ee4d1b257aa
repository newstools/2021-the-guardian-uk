Adam Yates won the Volta a Catalunya as Ineos took a clean sweep of the podium. The British rider Yates finished ahead of his teammates Richie Porte and Geraint Thomas after the final stage in Barcelona. Thomas De Gendt of Belgium won the last stage, breaking away from Matej Mohoric 5km from the finish line. The four-times Tour de France champion Chris Froome, who left Ineos for Israel-Start Up Nation during the close season, was never in the mix and finished 81st overall, 53:50 behind Yates.
