Tiers three to six of the 2020-21 season in English women’s football have been curtailed, the Football Association’s women’s football board has announced. All divisions below the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship have been declared incomplete with immediate effect, in reaction to the logistical problems caused by the continuing coronavirus pandemic. No further matches will take place and there will be no promotion or relegation between tiers three to six. All leagues in the 2019-20 season were curtailed on 25 May 2020 after the season was suspended in March before tiers three to six were declared null and void. This is the second successive season this has happened. The women’s football board said in statement that “extending the 2020-21 league season beyond the end of May 2021 would not be a viable option due to the operational issues faced by many clubs and leagues. “Clubs and leagues will however be encouraged to provide playing opportunities over the coming months by organising alternative fixtures in some format, where they are able and feel comfortable to do so following the return of grassroots football from 29 March and in line with the appropriate guidelines.” We’ve released the following update regarding tiers three to six of the Women’s Football Pyramid: The UK government’s roadmap out of lockdown means grassroots football in England is set to resume on 29 March. Regional leagues in tier seven will be allowed to make their own decision on finishing the season, following guidance given to grassroots leagues. The 2020-21 grassroots season was extended until the end of June by the Football Association. A process of upward club movement, “via application and based on set criteria”, will take place for those clubs seeking promotion from the seventh-tier divisions, something the FA admitted was “likely to result in expanded divisions at tiers 3-6 for the 2021-22 season, something which leagues have indicated they could accommodate”.
