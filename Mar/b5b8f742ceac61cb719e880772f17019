Trevor Dannatt was the designer of the first Jackson Pollock retrospective exhibition, curated at the fledgling Whitechapel Gallery by the gallerist Bryan Robertson in 1958. When I spoke to him on the 60th anniversary of the exhibition, he told me: “Bryan had his finger on the pulse. He managed to get a remarkable set of exhibitions of contemporary American art. This was the result of what you might call American cultural projection as part of the cold war and was probably CIA-funded.”Sue Rabbitt Roff Trevor Dannatt loved fine art and music, and was playing the piano until the last months of his life. But above all he loved words. Words and music in song and opera, the written word in prose, but especially words in poetry, the precision of which both mirrored and informed his work. In his centenary year he published a small volume of his own poetry. He was gentle, softly spoken, witty and remained deeply interested in the world around him to the end of his life. He was delightful company and a remarkable man.Frances Calman
