After reading about the shocking and heartbreaking news of the Atlanta shootings (FBI under pressure to tackle anti-Asian hate crime in wake of Atlanta shootings, 18 March), I can’t help but reflect on the prevalence of racism towards east and south-east Asians in our own country. The UK is rife with it. Covid-19 hasn’t caused the racism towards British east Asians and south-east Asians, as the UK media likes to claim. It’s always been here – the virus has just aggravated it and given racists supposed “legitimacy”. As a woman who is half Malaysian-Chinese and half white, I have spent my life being exoticised and stereotyped. From being told I’m supposed to be good at maths by a teacher because I’m “Asian”, being called “kawaii” by white men on dating apps, called a “mail-order bride” by an ex-boyfriend, groped at clubs because Chinese women are supposedly “meek”, to being told by a person from the black and minority ethnic community that I have nothing to complain about because I’m in a “model minority”. The racism towards the east and south-east Asian communities is disgusting and base, to the point I was not even surprised when I had “corona” yelled at me at the start of the pandemic. What will it take for the country and the government to wake up to this? Violence, probably. More violence towards the east and south-east Asian community.Alex SmithBiggleswade, Bedfordshire
