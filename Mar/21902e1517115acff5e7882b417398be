Country music star Dolly Parton has sung an adapted version of Jolene while she received her Covid vaccination in Nashville, Tennessee. To the tune of Jolene, she sang: “Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I’m begging of you, please don’t hesitate. Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, because once you’re dead, then that’s a bit too late.” We would like to hear your adapted song lyric suggestions encouraging people to get the Covid vaccine.
