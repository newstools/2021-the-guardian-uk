Your correspondent is wrong in saying the decision on assisted dying lies with the medical profession (Letters, 12 March). The law forbids assisted dying whatever the sufferer and their medical advisers think. Many in the medical profession support some form of assisted dying. The difficulty is how to frame the law so as to protect the vulnerable and deter the unscrupulous. Dr Peter EstcourtSouth Chailey, East Sussex • The leave campaigners told the truth (Exports to EU plunge by 40% in first month since Brexit, 12 March). Post-Brexit trade really is “frictionless”. No trade, no friction. Jonathan Stanley Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire • I was very interested to read about Matthew Newman’s temperature scale based on the number of people wearing shorts (Letters, 12 March). I do, however, have a query. The wearing of shorts by postal workers does not correlate in any way with the ambient temperature – but it is a predictable constant. Does Matthew have a correction factor within his formula to address this phenomena and thereby avoid a potentially falsely high temperature reading? Dr Robert BoonManchester • I remember hours spent in the late 1950s making bobbles by winding wool round small circles of cardboard with a hole in the middle (Letters, 12 March). The wool was then cut round the rim to unfurl and tie it. The purpose of the bobble was clearly to keep small children quiet and out of the way of adults with important things to do.
