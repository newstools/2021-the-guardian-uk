Excellent news that cervical screening postal HPV test kits are at long last being trialled (Home smear tests to be trialled in London, following lockdown delays, 24 February). For some women, the existing “routine” test is far worse than inconvenient, uncomfortable or embarrassing – it is traumatic. It can trigger memories and feelings about previous vaginal examinations or experiences of sexual abuse where women had no control over their bodies. Home testing will be a game-changer for all women. Bring it on, but please don’t blame or shame women who currently don’t take part (Letters, 25 February). They may have very good reasons.Judith WalkerBristol
