Marty Schottenheimer, who won 200 regular-season games with four NFL teams thanks to his “Martyball” brand of smash-mouth football but regularly fell short in the playoffs, has died. He was 77. Schottenheimer died on Monday night at a hospice in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to his family. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2014. He was moved to a hospice last month. Schottenheimer was ranked No 8 in coaching victories in NFL history. He went 200-126-1 in 21 seasons with the Cleveland Browns, Kansas City Chiefs, Washington and San Diego Chargers. His success was rooted in “Martyball,” a conservative approach that featured a strong running game and tough defense. He loved the mantra, “One play at a time,” which he would holler at his players in the pre-kickoff huddle. Winning in the regular season was never a problem. Schottenheimer’s teams won 10 or more games 11 times, including a 14-2 record with the Chargers in 2006 that earned them the AFC’s No 1 seed in the playoffs. But Schottenheimer was less successful in the playoffs, going just 5-13 in the postseason. His playoff demons followed him to the end of his career. In his final game, in January 2007, Schottenheimer’s Chargers, featuring NFL MVP LaDainian Tomlinson and a cast of Pro Bowlers, imploded with mind-numbing mistakes and lost a home divisional round playoff game to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, 24-21. A month later, owner Dean Spanos stunned the NFL when he fired Schottenheimer, mostly because of a personality clash between the coach and strong-willed general manager AJ Smith. Schottenheimer was 44-27 with the Cleveland Browns from 1984-88, 101-58-1 with Kansas City from 1989-98; 8-8 with Washington in 2001 and 47-33 with San Diego from 2002-06. His son, Brian, followed his father into the NFL and is currently a coach on the Jacksonville Jaguars staff.
