15 Elliot Daly Shocking early pass and at fault for Ioane’s early try. It has been a while since he really showcased his talents for England – a shame given they are considerable. 5/10 14 Anthony Watson First touch came a lot earlier than last week and far more involved as a result. Clever sidestep to beat two defenders for try to go with intercept. Much improved. 8/10 13 Henry Slade Bigger influence this week with a trademark arcing run to ease himself in and a clever grubber for May. England should build their attack around him. 7/10 12 Owen Farrell (capt) Kicking wasn’t perfect and coughed up a couple of knock-ons. Needlessly involved in some afters and lucky to get away with hit on Varney. 5/10 11 Jonny May Impressive acrobatic finish for try just before half-time and came looking for work far more often than against Scotland. 7/10 10 George Ford Took a while to get rid of the rust – inevitable when yo-yoing in and out of the starting lineup – but caused problems with his kicking from hand. 6/10 9 Ben Youngs Guilty of a forward pass to no one deep in Italy 22 but at least tried to make things happen, including a quick tap. Surely a day to look at others though. 5/10 1 Mako Vunipola Got through 52 minutes on his return. Not one of his more prominent afternoons but no complaints with some hard yards and solid scrummaging. 6/10 2 Luke Cowan-Dickie Eddie Jones has been toying with the idea of giving him a chance from the off for a while and he did not disappoint. Deserves to keep place. 8/10 3 Kyle Sinckler Welcome return, bringing much more in the loose than Stuart. Scrum contest was fairly even but offers himself as a carrier so often. Makes a dent too. 8/10 4 Maro Itoje A few penalties against but at the heart of a pack that had a point to prove. Linked up well with Cowan-Dickie at the lineout. Solid if unspectacular. 6/10 5 Jonny Hill First try for England may not be one for the scrapbook but produced a lovely pass to tee up Watson. Another whose performance was far better than last week. 7/10 6 Courtney Lawes Gave away an early penalty but lived up to his promise to “fly in” thereafter. Brought considerable oomph from flanker and improved lineout. Classy performance. 8/10 7 Tom Curry More like it. One thunderous tackle and back to his usual high-energy levels after dropping off against Scotland. 7/10 8 Billy Vunipola Another whose passing was loose. Good tackle on Varney before half-time, but was it legal? A bit better than last week without totally imposing himself. 6/10 REPLACEMENTS Jamie George (for Cowan-Dickie, 52) Solid 6; Ellis Genge (for M Vunipola, 52) Got stuck in 6; Will Stuart (for Sinckler ,74) N/A; Charlie Ewels (for Hill, 50) 5; Ben Earl (for B Vunipola, 59) 6; Jack Willis (for Lawes, 59) Immediate impact with try but went off in considerable pain 7; Dan Robson (for Youngs, 50) Lovely run and made a significant difference 8; Max Malins (for Willis, 65) N/A. 15 Jacopa Trulla 6; 14 Luca Sperandio 5; 13 Juan Ignacio Brex 5; 12 Carlo Canna 6; 11 Monty Ioane 7; 10 Paolo Garbisi 6; 9 Stephen Varney 7; 1 Andrea Lovotti 5; 2 Luca Bigi 6; 3 Marco Riccioni 5; 4 Marco Lazzaroni 5; 5 David Sisi 5; 6 Sebastian Negri 6; 7 Johan Meyer 6; 8 Michele Lamaro 7.
