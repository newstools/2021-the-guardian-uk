The former Notre Dame and New York Giants player Louis Nix has been found dead at the age of 29, his mother has confirmed. Nix was reported missing on Wednesday and on Saturday Jacksonville sheriff’s office said he had been located. His mother told Action News Jax that her son had died and his car had been recovered from a pond. Nix was shot during an attempted armed robbery in December at a Jacksonville gas station. Nix said a bullet had ricocheted into his lungs and he had spent 10 days in hospital after the shooting. “I know it sounds cliché, but more than anything, I’m happy to be alive,” Nix said at the time. Jacksonville sheriff’s office did not say that December’s robbery was linked to Nix’s death. Nix was a defensive star at Notre Dame before being drafted by the Houston Texans in 2014. Knee surgery ended his rookie season and he joined the New York Giants in 2015, but injuries continued to hamper his career and his NFL career ended after he was released by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2017.
