Tyson Fury, the WBC heavyweight champion, has admitted his highly anticipated fight with Anthony Joshua is no closer to being finalised. The bout against Joshua – holder of the WBA, WBO and IBF belts – has been touted for months but the added complication of the coronavirus pandemic has made negotiations even more difficult. “They’ve had a full year to make something happen, and it hasn’t happened as of yet. We’re no further forward today than we were a year ago,” Fury told ESPN. “The way [Covid-19] is at the moment, I don’t think [it has] got much to do with the fighters. It’s to do with the venue, date, place, site fees. It’s to do with everything but the fight itself.” Even if the fight does get arranged for 2021, Fury admits his long period of inactivity – his last fight against Deontay Wilder was a year ago this week, as a second rematch for December did not happen – is a cause for concern. “It was just a big mess-up. I should have boxed, because I’ve been so inactive. I’ve been out for over a year,” he said. “By the time I fight again, looking at maybe June if this Joshua fight happens, that will be a year and six months out of the ring, which is not ideal preparation for any super-fight. “If that fight doesn’t happen this summer, it’s got to happen sooner or later but [promoter] Top Rank has to give me two fights this year. I don’t care who it is. If it’s not Joshua, we’re looking to fight in April or early May, and the end of the year. If it is Joshua, then June and the end of the year, so 2021 is looking bright.”
