I’d expect rightwing politicians, who never miss a chance to demonise teachers, to talk about “schools reopening”, but can the media, government advisers and other commentators please stop doing so? Schools have never closed during the lockdowns, not even in the holidays. They have remained open for many children of key workers and those considered vulnerable.Michael BurnsNew Malden, London • Re vaccinations for people with learning disabilities (Editorial, 16 February), I wish people would appreciate the difference between a learning disability and a learning difficulty. The terms seem to be used interchangeably by the media, and even in official documents. I am dyslexic; it is a learning difficulty, but my intelligence is unaffected, so it is not a learning disability.Dr Daniel Emlyn-JonesOxford • I propose that our next national treasure should be Donald Macleod, the presenter of BBC Radio 3’s Composer of the Week. His inimitable voice and stories have brought huge pleasure and calm.Shelley SavageTring, Hertfordshire • If, instead of roadmaps (Letters, 17 February), Boris Johnson used the 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey maps we walkers use, he might see the rocks, precipices and bogs ahead, and try to avoid them. Bill CoopCottingham, East Yorkshire • I hope robotic dogs catch on among owners too posh to pick up their pet’s poo from the pavements (Mindfulness, laughter and robot dogs may relieve lockdown loneliness – study, 17 February). It would certainly be a relief for unwary pedestrians.Sam WhiteLewes, East Sussex
