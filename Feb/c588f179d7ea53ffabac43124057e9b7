England have added props Kyle Sinckler and Mako Vunipola to their squad for Saturday’s Six Nations clash with Italy. Sinckler missed the 11-6 Calcutta Cup defeat by Scotland after completing his ban for swearing at a referee while Vunipola has been out since November with an achilles injury. Making way to accommodate their return to Eddie Jones’ reduced 28-man Championship squad are tighthead Harry Williams and loosehead Tom West. Jones will welcome the availability of his first-choice props following a dismal display against Scotland in which his pack failed to gain any kind of foothold in the game. Sinckler is expected to slot straight back into the starting XV but given his two-month absence, Vunipola is more likely destined for a bench role.
