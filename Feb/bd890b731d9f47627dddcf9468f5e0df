This is a liquid take on the Tokyo banana, the popular Japanese cake that is shaped like its main component. It’s a great alternative to a whisky sour, though I’ve adapted what we do in the bar to make it more user-friendly at home. Serves 1 For the honey and black garlic syrup50ml runny honey 1 clove black garlic, chopped25ml water For the ginger syrup50ml water50g caster sugar25ml ginger juice (ready-made or fresh) For the drink2 slices fresh banana50ml good blended whisky – we use Suntory’s Toki20ml lemon juice10ml honey and black garlic syrup (see above and method)10ml ginger syrup (see above and method) For the honey and black garlic syrup, put everything in a small saucepan, cook over a low heat for five minutes, then leave to cool, strain and put in a sterilised container. For the ginger syrup, mix the water and sugar in a second small pan and heat gently, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Leave to cool, then add the ginger juice and put in a sterilised container. Now to build the drink. Put the banana slices in the base of a shaker and muddle (ie bash to break them up a bit). Add all the remaining ingredients and a handful of ice, and hard shake 10 times. Double strain into a rocks glass, add more ice to top and serve. • Wilson Sa Lemos, head bartender, Golden Gai, London W1
