Former NRL hooker Masada Iosefa has died in a tragic quadbiking accident in the Northern Territory, one night short of his 33rd birthday. Tributes from the Samoan and NRL communities have flown in after the ex-Penrith and Wests Tigers hooker was killed in Herbert, a rural town near Darwin, on Monday. NT Police said the quadbike rolled after the 32-year-old failed to negotiate a bend before colliding with a guard rail. He was not wearing a helmet. Iosefa was due to celebrate his 33rd birthday on Tuesday. Former Panthers teammate Frank Pritchard described Iosefa as “tough as nails” in a tribute posted on social media. “Never took a step back to any situation. Always had my back from the get-go,” Pritchard said. Cronulla prop Aaron Woods played with him at the Wests Tigers in 2012 and 2013, saying he was a “legend” and “one of the most solid blokes” he has played with. Cronulla captain and former Panther Wade Graham wrote on Instagram: “Rest easy brother.” Iosefa played 57 NRL games since making his debut with the Panthers in 2008 as well as four Tests for Samoa from 2009 until 2013. In recent years he played in the Queensland state cup, winning a premiership with rugby club Rockhampton Brothers in 2020.
