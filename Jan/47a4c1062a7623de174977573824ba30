We are among the many people still struggling to get a refund for Covid-cancelled flights booked though Lastminute.com. Our son’s flight from America in May was cancelled by Austrian Airlines in April and, after very many emails, we got a reply from Lastminute.com in June, offering a refund of £517. No payment was received. In November, an email told us we had to provide bank details. Then, without explanation, it reduced the amount to £173 and said we had to accept within three months. We have sent numerous emails. There is no working phone line. The airline has told us twice it has repaid Lastminute.com, but can’t give the sum, and says we must contact the agent. SL, Lewes It will be little consolation to know that you are not alone – Lastminute.com has been one of our most complained-about travel firms in recent months. In December the Competition and Markets Authority forced it to start refunding passengers following an investigation. After a great deal of pressure on my part, Switzerland-based Lastminute.com finally agreed to call you. You have accepted the £173 to put an end to the matter. It seems the company had replied to your emails, albeit from a different address, and these ended up in your spam folder. When things finally get back to normal, you might want to stick to UK-based travel agents or, better still, book flights with airlines direct.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
