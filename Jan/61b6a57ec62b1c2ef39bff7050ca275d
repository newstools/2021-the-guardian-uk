Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Everton will consider selling Moise Kean to Paris Saint-Germain should the French champions want the striker on a permanent basis. Kean joined PSG on a season’s loan after struggling to impressat Everton, where he scored four goals and made six Premier League starts after his £29m arrival from Juventus. The 20-year-old has thrived in France, with 10 goals in 17 appearances encouraging the prospect of a permanent transfer. Everton have repeatedly stressed that the Italy international remains part of their long-term plans but Ancelotti admits the club are open to an offer that would recoup their outlay. “First we have to look at the desire of the player,” the Everton manager said. “If the player wants to stay at PSG then of course the two clubs have to sit at the table to talk about this, and we are open to talk. The club is open to talk if PSG wants to sign Moise Keane, who is doing really well in this moment.” Bernard has also been linked with a move from Goodison Park, to Roma as part of a swap for the on-loan goalkeeper Robin Olsen, but Ancelotti claimed the Brazilian would stay. “If the player desires to stay here we are not going to force him to leave. Until now he is happy to stay here. He didn’t play a lot but he never came to say: ‘I want to leave’ and we don’t want him to sell him full stop. This is the situation at the moment.” Ancelotti plans to rest Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and Jordan Pickford from Saturday’s FA Cup third round tie against Rotherham but has Lucas Digne available only six weeks after the left-back underwent ankle surgery. “His recovery was really fast – the medical staff and him did a fantastic job,” Ancelotti said. “He trained all week with us and is fit, in good condition and can play tomorrow. We know Digne is a top professional. The surgery was good, the rehab was really good and it was unbelievable to see Digne so early in training.”
