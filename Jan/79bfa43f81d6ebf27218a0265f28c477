Billionaire rapper and producer Dr Dre says he will be “back home soon” after receiving medical treatment at a Los Angeles hospital for a reported brain aneurysm. The six-time Grammy award winner said in a social media post on Tuesday night that he was thankful for well wishes from friends, family and fans. TMZ reported that he had a brain aneurysm on Monday and was recovering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Dre did not give a reason for his hospitalisation. “I’m doing great and getting excellent care from my medical team,” he said. “I will be out of the hospital and back home soon. Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!” His representative has not immediately responded to an email. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, has produced hits for Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and more. He’s won six Grammys. Born in the Southern California city of Compton, he broke out on the music scene as a co-founding member of NWA, producing the group’s groundbreaking 1988 debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Dre produced his own hits and multiplatinum albums, along with crafting music for many others including Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Nas, Busta Rhymes, the Game and Anderson .Paak. He also found success outside beyond the rap genre, producing pop hits for Gwen Stefani and Mary J Blige. Dre founded Beats Electronics in 2008 with Jimmy Iovine and six years later they launched a streaming subscription service, Beats Music. Apple acquired both in a $3bn deal in 2014.
