Dimuth Karunaratne, the Sri Lanka captain, and the seamer Vishwa Fernando led a fightback against South Africa on the second day of the second Test but the visitors remain precariously placed in a fast-moving contest on Monday. Fernando took his first Test five-wicket haul as Sri Lanka dismissed South Africa for 302 in their first innings, restricting the hosts to a 145-run lead, while Karunaratne scored an unbeaten 91 in the tourists’ second innings. They were 150 for four at stumps, leading by five runs with three days still to play at the Wanderers Stadium. South Africa, who won the first Test in Pretoria last week, started the day on 148 for one in reply to Sri Lanka’s first innings tally of 157 and had hopes of settling in for a long stint at the crease in order to build a match-winning lead. Dean Elgar, 92 not out overnight, went to his century while Rassie van der Dussen survived an early chance to pass 50. But it all crumbled after the first hour’s play as Elgar was removed for 127, after a 184-run second-wicket partnership, and Van der Dussen was dismissed in the next over for 67. Sri Lanka’s bowlers, after struggling on the opening day, found a steady line and length and the hosts lost their last nine wickets for 84 runs, missing out on an opportunity to build a considerable lead. Fernando cleaned up the tail to finish with figures of five for 101. Sri Lanka’s second innings started poorly with Kusal Perera dismissed cheaply. Perera was clean bowled by Lungi Ngidi for one. But Karunaratne and Lahiru Thirimanne put on 85 for the second wicket before Ngidi snagged Thirimanne for 31. The bowler then removed Kusal Mendis with the next ball, both dismissals sealed with impressive diving catches from the wicketkeeper, Quinton de Kock. Karunaratne will resume on Tuesday nine runs short of his century, with Niroshan Dickwella on 18 not out.
