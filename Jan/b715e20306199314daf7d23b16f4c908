LeBron James and his Los Angeles Lakers teammates were already upset after a Wisconsin prosecutor on Tuesday decided not to charge a police officer who shot a black man last year. Then came Wednesday when a violent mob loyal to US president Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol to delay Congress from certifying the results of November’s election. What James watched on television along with his family continued to reinforce his view of the wide divide in the country. “We live in two Americas and that was a prime example of that yesterday. If you don’t understand or see that then you need to take a step back. Not just one step but four or five or even 10 steps backward,” James said Thursday night after finishing with a team-high 27 points in the Lakers’ 118-109 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. “How do you want your kids or grandkids to live in this beautiful country? Because yesterday was not it. “I couldn't help but wonder, if it was my kind storming the Capitol, what would have been the outcome?" @KingJames addresses yesterday’s events in Washington, D.C. pic.twitter.com/Csgl7ZeSSi “I couldn’t help but to wonder if those were my kind storming the Capitol what would have been the outcome. We all know what would have happened if anyone even got close let alone storm or get in the offices.” James wore a shirt walking into Staples Center before the game that said ‘DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW?’ in large block lettering. He also had the message written on his sneakers during the game. In smaller letters, the shirt also contained a slogan invoked by James in the past: “In memoriam of the countless Black lives lost to police brutality and racial injustice.” The four-time NBA Most Valuable Player expanded on his thoughts in a post on Instagram, describing the situation as “2 AMERIKKKAS”: DO YOU 🤬🤬🤬🤬 UNDERSTAND NOW???!! I know the answer to that. You still don’t cause no matter what happens you still won’t be judge, looked at crazy, chained, beaten, shot to death cause of the color of your skin!!!! 2 AMERIKKKAS we live in and it was at FULL CAPACITY LIVE IN DIRECT yesterday in our Nations CAPITAL AT THE CAPITAL!! 🤦🏾‍♂️😢😢😢. #IPrayForBetterDaysForMyPeople 🙏🏾✊🏾🖤👑 When asked what we meant by his shirt, James said he wants people to understand what athletes and black people are saying. “You will never understand the feeling of being a black man and woman in America,” James said. “Do you understand how hard it is for us to continue to inspire and give everything we got? Everyone jumps on the bandwagon of what we provide, what we bring. “The way we dress, our music, our culture, our food. Everyone steals from what we do and then they want to act like they did it or they brought it to this world. We don’t get our due diligence. We don’t get respect. We don’t get anything back for what we’ve given to this country besides a slap in the face.” “We don’t get anything back from what we’ve given this country besides a slap in the face.” @KingJames shares his thoughts on being Black in America. pic.twitter.com/d4sx6XnmD5 Tuesday’s decision by a prosecutor in Kenosha, Wisconsin, not to bring charges against the officer who shot Jacob Blake drew ire throughout the NBA. Blake’s shooting was one of many social issues players focused on last summer when play resumed in the Orlando, Florida, bubble. James has remained a critic of Trump during his four years in office and said that what happened at the Capitol was a direct correlation of what Trump represents. One thing you can never get back is time. We’ve literally just shit away four years “The events that took place yesterday was a direct correlation of the president that’s in the seat right now: of his actions, his beliefs, his wishes,” James said. “He cares about nobody besides himself. Nobody. Absolutely nobody. He doesn’t care about this country. He doesn’t care about his family. He doesn’t care about anybody besides himself. “We saw the tweets along the whole path to this destruction. Over the last four years we all knew. One thing you can never get back is time. We’ve literally just shit away four years. How do we recoup that?” He added: “Yesterday was shameful. We are supposed to be setting an example for all other countries on how to run things and change the world and yesterday we looked like a third-, fourth-, fifth-world country. It was just very embarrassing.” Players and coaches from both teams locked arms in a circle at midcourt during the national anthem before Thursday’s game at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.

That doesn’t happen unless there’s a wink and a nod somewhere. That just doesn’t happen. It’s never happened at any protest anybody’s ever been to. “That’s why I don’t think it’s so far fetched for people to start talking about the 25th amendment. We know it probably won’t happen.” Popovich also took time to laud James, calling him an “iconic figure”. “As a human being and citizen and someone who looks at the social issues of our time, he doesn’t do it with hate. He just tells the truth,” Popovich said of James.
