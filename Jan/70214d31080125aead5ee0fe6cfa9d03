World No 1 Novak Djokovic, citing blisters, made a shock withdrawal from an exhibition match before making a U-turn and suddenly taking to the court midway through the encounter in Adelaide. Djokovic was released from quarantine earlier Friday ahead of his scheduled exhibition match against Jannik Sinner at Memorial Drive. But he withdrew from the match just 30 minutes before being due to take to the court, with his camp citing severe blisters on his right hand. He was replaced by compatriot Filip Krajinović, who won the first set against Sinner 6-3. Djokovic then appeared on court and took the place of Krajinović for the start of the second set. He showed no obvious sign of discomfort and did not have taping on his right hand. Djokovic won his set against Sinner 6-3 and then apologised. “I am sorry that I didn’t step in on the court from the beginning,” he said. “I had to do some treatment with my physio and wasn’t feeling my best the last couple of days. “I wanted to play ... it’s not easy. But it’s part of what we do. We are professional athletes, we learn over the years to play with the pain. It’s just a case whether that pain is bearable or not. “Coming off from the hard training block and having ATP Cup and the Australian Open around the corner, you don’t want to risk it too much. But the emotion in me was so strong to come out to the court today. Seeing the full stands – I had to play.” Djokovic and others among tennis’ elite including Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal quarantined in Adelaide ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne starting 8 February. The South Australian government created Friday’s exhibition event also featuring, among others, Ash Barty, Simona Halep and Venus Williams. Djokovic appeared at a brief media call about two-and-a-half hours before his scheduled match. The 17-time grand slam winner, on release from hotel confines, went to a nearby park. “A walk in the park, just putting bare feet on the ground,” Djokovic said at the media call. “Just doing something that I didn’t have a chance to do. So just having space, that is what we all kind of missed.” OUT: Krajinovic 🇷🇸 IN: @DjokerNole 🇷🇸 After taking the opening set 6-3, Krajinovic substitutes with the World No.1 at #AdelaideTennis 🙌 pic.twitter.com/0HlNocEuFo At the park, Djokovic was photographed performing an Australian rules handball with his right hand and also marking an AFL football. He said he “thrilled to be out” of quarantine. “It feels just a little bit strange, to be honest,” he said. Djokovic dodged a question about Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, who on social media branded the Serb a “tool”. Djokovic earlier this month requested Tennis Australia reduce restrictions on players quarantining in Melbourne, which prompted Kyrgios’s online response. Djokovic said his letter to Australian Open boss Craig Tiley was miscontrued. “The letter that I sent to Craig that was leaked was a private letter with suggestions ... it was portrayed as demands and that is not true,” Djokovic said. “I just suggested a few things for the guys stuck in Melbourne like equipment. “But it was misconstrued. And I understand that there is a lot of anger and suffering happening at the moment for people inside and outside of Australia because of what everyone is experiencing. So many people are losing their jobs and all you can do is have compassion and send them my support.”
