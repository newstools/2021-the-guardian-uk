Schalke’s American teenager Matthew Hoppe scored a hat-trick on only his fifth Bundesliga appearance to carry the struggling side to a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim and snap the Royal Blues’ 30-game winless streak in the league. Hoppe, who made his Bundesliga debut in November, chipped the ball over Oliver Baumann in Hoffenheim’s goal after a superb pass by Amine Harit to finish off a quick break three minutes before half-time. The pair combined perfectly twice more for the 19-year-old Hoppe to score again in the 57th and 63rd minutes. The Morocco international Harit then turned scorer by drilling in their fourth goal after 80 minutes as Schalke climbed off the bottom of the table. “I have no words for this day. I cannot really describe it,” said a beaming Hoppe, holding on to the match ball. “Just very happy.” The California-born player joined Schalke in 2019 from the Barça Residency Academy in Arizona. Schalke, whose last league win was back in January 2020, were a defeat away from matching Tasmania Berlin’s German top-flight record of 31 matches without a win from the 1965-66 season. Hoppe becomes the youngest American to score three goals in a single match in Europe’s top five leagues. “It gives some confidence, some momentum,” Hoppe said. “We have 19 games left, and hopefully we can keep the wins coming and we can stay high in the first division.”
