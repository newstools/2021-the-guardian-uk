The biggest meme of 2021 – at least until Bernie Sanders’ mittens came along – has translated into UK chart success, as the song at the heart of the sea shanty craze debuts in the Top 40. Wellerman, with its infectious chorus heralding the arrival of “sugar, tea and rum”, reaches No 37 this week, via a version by the Bristol vocal group the Longest Johns. The shanty originated in Australia and New Zealand in the 1830s and tells the tale of a whaling crew looking forward to their leave as they strive to make a catch. It is the most popular song to have emerged from the recent explosion in popularity of sea shanties, primarily on TikTok. One of the leading practitioners, Scottish postman Nathan Evans, was signed to major label Polydor this week and could take Wellerman to new heights in next week’s chart. His newly recorded version is released on 22 January, alongside a dance remix by 220 Kid and Billen Ted. “They’ve changed my life,” Evans said of sea shanties earlier this week. “They’ve opened up so many doors and opportunities that I would never have had if it wasn’t for them.” New Zealand folk historian John Archer told the Guardian this week that the song had contemporary resonances: “My guess is that the Covid lockdowns have put millions of young [people] into a similar situation that young whalers were in 200 years ago: confined for the foreseeable future, often far from home, running out of necessities, always in risk of sudden death, and spending long hours with no communal activities to cheer them up.” At the top of this week’s chart, Olivia Rodrigo has a second week at No 1 with Drivers License, which broke streaming records in its debut week. The 17-year-old Disney star also reaches No 32 with All I Want. The album chart is topped by You Me At Six, scoring their sixth Top 10 album and second No 1. Sleaford Mods earn their highest ever placing, with new album Spare Ribs reaching No 4.
