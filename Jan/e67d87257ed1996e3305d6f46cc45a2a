I wake up at… The front door, sometimes, car keys in hand. The sleepwalking is getting so bad now that I have had to invest in a steering lock. Breakfast is French toast. It’s very similar to English toast. The only difference is, when I’m eating it, a Turkish friend comes round and insults me. Do you exercise? I used to play Sunday football, but I have all but given up, because I’m too old and fat. After a 45-minute match I’d end up spending the rest of the day recovering in bed with baby oil and painkillers, knackered; a full 90 minutes would write off my whole week. What do you do for fun? I try to think of ridiculous names for cafés that don’t exist and tell people I love them, before a trip to the shops – anywhere that has very relaxed security. I’ve recently developed an unfortunate habit of shoplifting Antony Worrall Thompson cookbooks. The perfect Sunday lunch? Everything on the menu at Monty Tonksquirters Triangular Wheel-Brace Emporium & Grill. A Sunday memory? Sleeping through my call time in Canada for my cameo in The Love Guru, a movie with Mike Myers. I was so exhausted I didn’t wake up until 4pm. I’m still on the poster and in the credits despite not doing anything, although it turned out to be terrible. I actually get fired from films quite a lot. My Sunday extravagance… Half an ounce of rough shag. I have no idea what that means, I just heard it in an old Sherlock Holmes movie. Watson told him off about it. The last thing I look at on my phone on Sunday night… My face. I’ve been taking a selfie every night at exactly the same time for 10 years now. I delete the pictures as soon as I take them. I don’t actually want to know what I look like, thanks. See Omid Djalili: The Good Times Tour from March 2021. Tickets and information, omidnoagenda.com
