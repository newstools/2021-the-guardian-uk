Jean Michaël Seri is set to join Bordeaux on loan until the end of the season having made just one start for Fulham this season. The Ivory Coast midfielder, who was signed from Nice for £25m in July 2018, spent last season on loan at Galatasaray and has yet to feature for Scott Parker’s side in the Premier League this season, even as a substitute. His solitary start came against Brentford in the Carabao Cup in October. It is understood that the Turkish club were interested in taking Seri on loan again but he is expected to join Jean-Louis Gasset’s side, who are currently seventh in Ligue 1. The 29-year-old’s contract at Craven Cottage expires next year but there is an option to extend it by a further year. Fulham have already allowed Stefan Johansen to join Queens Park Rangers on loan this month and could also allow defender Maxime Le Marchand to depart. Parker is believed to be keen to add players to his squad before the transfer deadline but admitted this week that it depended on the club’s owners. “If something happens between now and the window shutting who can help us, amazing, and they can help the players push on again,” he said. “If not, we’ll keep improving like we have.” West Brom and West Ham are among the clubs to have been linked with a loan move for Bordeaux’s former Sunderland striker Josh Maja. The 22-year-old has scored twice in 11 Ligue 1 starts this season.
