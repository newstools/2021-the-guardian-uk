With 2020 finally over and the new year in full swing, many of us are starting to consider whether it’s about time we took the tree down. However, with many working from home, we’d like to find out whether the nation’s Christmas trees are set to stay around longer than usual. There are different schools of thought on when exactly this should be done by. The most proactive of us will have everything down by the time they sit down for Boxing Day dinner but traditionally many wait until twelfth night (5 January) to do so. In Tudor England, decorations usually weren’t removed prior to Candlemas (February 2). So, if you want to keep your decorations up – at least you’ve got history on your side! We’d like to hear from those who’re planning on keeping their Christmas decorations up longer this year. But you’re welcome to get in touch if you’re keen to get them down too.
