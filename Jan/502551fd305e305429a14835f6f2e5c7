Aside from Ameliorate launching products to treat keratosis pilaris (the rough bumpy skin that resembles a plucked chicken), body care hasn’t been particularly innovative. Yes, there are oils that smell so good they double up as scents; there are moisturisers that penetrate your skin, as opposed to lazily languishing on the surface; body washes that don’t dry and irritate… But proper innovative formulas using active ingredients? Pah. But that’s changing. Now there are salicylic and lactic acid-infused washes (La Roche-Posay) and sprays (Murad) to treat and prevent acne and breakouts below the neck. Body lotions that incorporate vitamin C (Beauty Pie) and retinol (Paula’s Choice) to combat skin dullness and ageing. Luxe moisturisers (Augustinus Bader) now deliver much more than indulgence, as do antioxidant-rich exfoliating soaps and scrubs (Glossier and Aesop). “Doctor” brands such as Dennis Gross and Sam Bunting are using ingredients like bakuchiol and niacinamide to ensure your body gets treated as well as the skin on your face.
